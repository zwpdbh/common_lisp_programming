** Global Variable
   - A variable that is defined globally in Lisp is called a top-level definition.
     #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
       (defparameter *big* 100)
       (defparameter *small* 1)
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : *SMALL*

     #+END_SRC
** Basic Lisp Eitquette
   - spaces and line breaks are completely ignored when Lisp reads in your 
** Defining Global Functions in Lisp
   - Defining the guess-my-number Function
     #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
       (defun guess-my-number ()
	 (ash (+ *small* *big*) -1))
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : GUESS-MY-NUMBER

   - Every command in Common Lisp generates a return value
     - The 'defun'
   - "ash" is commonly used for binary searches in Lisp. It looks at a number in binary form, and then shifts its binary bits to the left or right, dropping any bits lost in the process.
     - +1 means shift bits to left.
     - -1 means shift bits to right, half the integer.
*** Defining the smaller and bigger functions
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (defun smaller ()
	(setf *big* (1- (guess-my-number)))
	(guess-my-number))

      (defun bigger ()
	(setf *small* (1+ (guess-my-number)))
	(guess-my-number))
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : BIGGER
